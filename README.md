## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a student at The Ohio State University.
Currently, I only have one semester left for my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering.
While I have done a bit of coding, I'm still learning how to optomize GitHub and clean up my projects.
Hopefully, I make it back here to update this and don't forget
